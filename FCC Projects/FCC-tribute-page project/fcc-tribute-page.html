                <p id="tribute-info"><em>Wardell Stephen "Steph" Curry II (born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the
            Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is considered by some to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.
             A six-time NBA All-Star, he has been named NBA Most Valuable Player twice, and won three NBA championships with the Warriors. 
             He is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry, and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry.
            He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams to regularly utilize the three-point shot</em></p>
            <h2 ><b>Early Life</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <ul class="left">
                <li>Curry played college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set 
                the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, Curry also set the single-season 
                NCAA record for three-pointers made, and was then selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA Draft. In 2014–15, 
                Curry won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the 
                first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, 
                the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season. After losing in the 2016 NBA Finals, he led the Warriors to three consecutive NBA
                 Finals (2017, 2018, 2019), winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><b>Basketball Records</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <ul class="left">
                <li>During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season, with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, 
                    and again in 2016 with 402. Curry is currently third in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history, and alongside teammate Klay Thompson, the pair 
                    have earned the nickname of the Splash Brothers; in 2013–14, they set the record for combined three-pointers in an NBA season with 484, a record they
                     broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015–16 season (678).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><b>NBA championship and MVP (2014–2015)</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <ul class="left">
                    <li>
                        Prior to the start of the 2014–15 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach. Kerr implemented 
                        significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot, helping the team evolve into a title 
                        contender. On February 4, Curry scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Dallas Mavericks. He was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game
                         and won the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night. On April 9, he broke his own league record for three-pointers made in a season during a game
                        against the Portland Trail Blazers. The Warriors finished the year with 67 wins and Curry was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player after posting averages of
                        23.8 points, 7.7 assists and 2 steals per game. Over the course of the season, he sat out 17 fourth quarters due to Golden State's wide margins of victory.
                         <br>In Game 5 of the Conference Semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry became the first player in league history to register six three-pointers and six
                        steals in a game. In Game 6, he made a playoff career-high eight three-pointers en route to a series-clinching victory. In Game 3 of the Conference Finals 
                        against the Houston Rockets, he broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single postseason. The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets to earn
                        a Finals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry struggled to start the series, converting on only 22 percent of his field goals in Game 2.
                        In Game 5, he scored 37 points, and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win their first championship in 40 years. For the Finals, Curry averaged 
                        26 points and 6.3 assists per game.

            <h2><b>Unanimous MVP and historic season (2015–2016)</b></h2>
            <hr>
            <ul class="left">
                    <li>
                        To start the 2015–16 season, Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989–90 to score 118 points in his team's first three games,
                        including a season-high 53 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in the third game. The Warriors made NBA history on November 24 when they became
                        the first team ever to start 16–0 with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers, before improving to 24–0 on December 11 with a double-overtime win over the Boston Celtics.
                        Their streak was broken the following day against the Milwaukee Bucks. On December 28, Curry recorded his sixth career triple-double with 23 points, a career-high
                        14 rebounds and 10 assists in a 122–103 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game against the Kings, Curry was guarded by his brother Seth for the first time in their NBA careers.
                        On January 22, he recorded his second triple-double of the season with 39 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 122–110 win over the Indiana Pacers. He made eight three-pointers in
                        the game to reach 200 for the season, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 200 three-pointers in four straight seasons. On February 3, he made 11 three-pointers 
                        (including seven in the first quarter) and scored 51 points (including a career-high 36 points in the first half) to lead the Warriors past the Washington Wizards 134–121. 
                        His 51 points tied Gilbert Arenas and Michael Jordan for the Verizon Center record.</li><br>
                    <li>
                        During the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry competed in his third straight All-Star game for the West, and competed in the Three-Point Contest, where he lost in the final round
                         to teammate Klay Thompson. At 48–4, the Warriors entered the All-Star break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls 
                         and 1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers.
                    
                        On February 25, Curry made 10 three-pointers and scored 51 points to lead the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130–114. Curry topped 50 points for the third time in 2015–16, 
                        the first player to do it that many times since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did so in 2008–09. Curry also surpassed Kyle Korver's mark of 127 straight games with a three-pointer. 
                        In the following game two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime thanks to a Curry three-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining. Curry finished with 
                        46 points as his winning shot was his 12th three-pointer, tying the NBA single-game record (with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall). He also broke his own NBA record for threes 
                        in a season, leaving the new mark at 288. On March 7, in a win over the Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 regular-season three-pointers. 
                        On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, snapping an NBA-record 
                        54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena. On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 
                        112–101 win over the San Antonio Spurs.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        In the Warriors' regular-season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry achieved another shooting milestone, becoming the first player to make 400 three-pointers in a season by 
                        knocking down 10 from long range on his way to 46 points and 402 total three-pointers. With a 125–104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing 
                        the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls' 72–10 record to finish the 2015–16 season with just nine losses. With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club, 
                        representing the shooting percentages from the field (.504), beyond the arc (.454), and the free-throw line (.908). The league's leading scorer at 30.1 points per game, Curry was named the league's first 
                        ever unanimous MVP, becoming the 11th player in NBA history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004–05 and 2005–06.

                    <li>
                        In the 2016 playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round despite Curry only playing in the first half of Games 1 and 4 due to injury. A right MCL injury kept him out of the first three 
                        games of the second round. In Game 4 of the second-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Curry came off the bench to score 40 points in a 132–125 overtime win. Seventeen of those points came in the 
                        extra period, an NBA record for points scored by an individual in overtime. Curry led the Warriors to a 4–1 victory over the Trail Blazers, as they moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. 
                        After going down 3–1, he helped the Warriors rally to win the series 4–3 and advance to their second straight NBA Finals.

                    <li>
                        In the Finals, Curry's play relative to his regular season performance remained inconsistent, as it had been since he returned from injury against Portland. Still, he broke Danny Green's record of 27 three-pointers made in 
                        a Finals. However, the Warriors, despite being up 3–1 in the series, were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and became the first team in NBA Finals history to lose a series after leading 3–1. In the game 
                        seven loss, Curry scored 17 points on 6-of-19 shooting
